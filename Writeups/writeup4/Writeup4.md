#### Pipeline

### SLURM Pipeline
Make a different script for DESeq2 that would take the output Salmon data. 
Then capture the job ID of the Salmon array job once all the outputs of Salmon are present. 
Then have it so that it is submitted to the DEseq2 job only when all the tasks in the Salmon array are done.
